/**
 * This is the representation of a (local) Coral session.  Starting a session on a Coral server can only be done by
 * sending POST request to [Sessions].  A local session may contain imported agents that run on other Coral servers,
 * those agents do not have any special representation in the Local session, but on the remote server the agents ran are
 * part of a [RemoteSession].
 *
 * This class is not responsible for orchestrating agents, but it is responsible for handling any session data that the
 * agents have access to, including threads and messages.
 *
 * All agent states in this session are represented by [SessionAgent] classes listed in [agents].  A [SessionAgent]
 * instance contains all runtime information for that agent, including its MCP server.
 *
 * @param id This is a unique identifier for this session.  This should be cryptographically secure as it is used to
 * uniquely identify a session in a potential multi-tenant environment.
 *
 * @param paymentSessionId This the payment session created by coral-escrow.  This will be null if there are no paid
 * agents in [agentGraph].
 *
 * @param agentGraph Each agent in [AgentGraph.agents] will create a [SessionAgent].  Each group in [AgentGraph.groups]
 * will connect the [SessionAgent]s and all tools specified in [AgentGraph.customTools] will be made available to
 * the agents in this session.
